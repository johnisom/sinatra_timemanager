    <p>Welcome! This application is a time management system targeted towards the student. Of course, anybody can use and benefit from this application, and I encourage you to do so. This help page has 4 sections, each relating to the 4 different 'commands' one can perform whilst using this app. To find out more about this application and its creator, check out the <i>About</i> section.</p>

  <div id="view">
    <h2>View</h2>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div id="start">
    <h2>Start</h2>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div id="stop">
    <h2>Stop</h2>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div id="undo">
    <h2>Undo</h2>
    <p>The undo command is the command that undoes the previous start or stop command.</p>
    <p>You would use this command if you accidentally pressed start or stop, if you weren't actually using your time productively since you pressed start, or other reasons that you wish to undo the last start/stop command.</p>
    <p><strong class="warning">WARNING:</strong> The undo command is a double edged sword: it is the gracious savior of this application, but can be the cursed devil if used carelessly. Make sure you use this with care.</p>
