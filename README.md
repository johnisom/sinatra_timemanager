# Time Manager

Time Manager is a [Sinatra][sinatra] web application for tracking study/work time so that you know exactly how many of your precious hours are going to good use. The web app is hosted [here][time-manager] on Heroku and the Github repository is [here][github].

Inspiration for this app comes from a similar command-line application that I had previously made with Python. The Github repository for that little project can be found [here][python-tm].

This app was created as an optional project for [Launch School][ls]'s RB175 course. The two other optional projects I created are the games [Tic Tac Toe][ttt] and [Twenty-One][twenty-one].

## Usage

Help and instructions on how to use this application can be found on the [help section][help] of the app website.
