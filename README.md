# sinatra_timemanager

Based off of my Python CLI app, which can be found [here](python).
This allows you to check in and check out to track your time studying/working
so you can see how much of your precious hours are actually going towards
what you want.

I chose to do this as an RB175 optional project because it is much more
back-end intensive than the other 2 ([Tic Tac Toe](ttt) and [TwentyOne](21))
projects that I've done.

[ttt]: https://github.com/johnisom/sinatra_ttt
[21]: https://github.com/johnisom/sinatra_twentyone
